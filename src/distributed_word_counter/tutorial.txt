To use the application, save the text files you want to analyse
into the server/files directory.

You need also to have mongodb into your machine, because it's
the database used to store the files on server side.

Then, run the DatabaseHandler class as main, so that the files are
loaded into mongodb collection.

Run serverMain and clientMain to start communication. You can pass
the port to use as args[0] for both.

You can run as many clients as you want, just change the
numToListen attribute on ServerConnector.py .

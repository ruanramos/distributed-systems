- The client main is the entry point

- ClientConnector implements the user interface, divided into a connection
 handler, a input handler and a screen printer

- The client sends messages to the server as a JSON object

- The message contains the option chosen by the user, the filename and the 
number of words that should be analyzed

- All the interaction with the user is done by the screen printer and input handler

- Client connector detains the communication responsibility

- The server answer comes as a JSON object, containing an answer, 
a possible list of files, a possible filename and a possible result 
of an analysis

- Client makes the formmating, but it receives all information already ordered 
by the server
